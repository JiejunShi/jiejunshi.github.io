We are a **Computational Biology Research Group** at [School of Life Science and Technology](https://life.tongji.edu.cn/) in Tongji University. We develop bioinformatics methods to interpret the large-scale biomedical data and reveal the molecular basis of human diseases.

**Research interests:**

* The effect of epigenetic polymorphism in tumorigenesis and early development
* Tumor early diagnosis by novel epigenetic feature discovery
* Multi-omics data mining for molecular characteristics of human diseases
