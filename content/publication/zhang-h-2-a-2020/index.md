abstract: 'Epigenetic regulation of gene transcription has been shown to coordinate
  with nutrient availability, yet the mechanisms underlying this coordination remain
  incompletely understood. Here, we show that glucose starvation suppresses histone
  2A K119 monoubiquitination (H2Aub), a histone modification that correlates with
  gene repression. Glucose starvation suppressed H2Aub levels independently of energy
  stress-mediated AMP-activated protein kinase activation and possibly through NADPH
  depletion and subsequent inhibition of BMI1, an integral component of polycomb-repressive
  complex 1 (PRC1) that catalyzes H2Aub on chromatin. Integrated transcriptomic and
  epigenomic analyses linked glucose starvation-mediated H2Aub repression to the activation
  of genes involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. We further
  showed that this epigenetic mechanism has a role in glucose starvation-induced cell
  death and that pharmacologic inhibition of glucose transporter 1 and PRC1 synergistically
  promoted ER stress and suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Together, these results
  reveal a hitherto unrecognized epigenetic mechanism coupling glucose availability
  to the ER stress response. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings link glucose deprivation
  and H2A ubiquitination to regulation of the ER stress response in tumor growth and
  demonstrate pharmacologic susceptibility to inhibition of polycomb and glucose transporters.'
