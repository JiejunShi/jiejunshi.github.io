abstract: 'Chromatin remodeling plays a critical role in gene regulation and impacts
  many biological processes. However, little is known about the relationship between
  chromatin remodeling dynamics and in vivo cell lineage commitment. Here, we reveal
  the patterns of histone modification change and nucleosome positioning dynamics
  and their epigenetic regulatory roles during the in vivo glial differentiation in
  early Drosophila embryos. The genome-wide average H3K9ac signals in promoter regions
  are decreased in the glial cells compared to the neural progenitor cells. However,
  H3K9ac signals are increased in a group of genes that are up-regulated in glial
  cells and involved in gliogenesis. There occurs extensive nucleosome remodeling
  including shift, loss, and gain. Nucleosome depletion regions (NDRs) form in both
  promoters and enhancers. As a result, the associated genes are up-regulated. Intriguingly,
  NDRs form in two fashions: nucleosome shift and eviction. Moreover, the mode of
  NDR formation is independent of the original chromatin state of enhancers in the
  neural progenitor cells.'
