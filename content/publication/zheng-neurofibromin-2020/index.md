abstract: We report that neurofibromin, a tumor suppressor and Ras-GAP (GTPase-activating
  protein), is also an estrogen receptor-α (ER) transcriptional co-repressor through
  leucine/isoleucine-rich motifs that are functionally independent of GAP activity.
  GAP activity, in turn, does not affect ER binding. Consequently, neurofibromin depletion
  causes estradiol hypersensitivity and tamoxifen agonism, explaining the poor prognosis
  associated with neurofibromin loss in endocrine therapy-treated ER+ breast cancer.
  Neurofibromin-deficient ER+ breast cancer cells initially retain sensitivity to
  selective ER degraders (SERDs). However, Ras activation does play a role in acquired
  SERD resistance, which can be reversed upon MEK inhibitor addition, and SERD/MEK
  inhibitor combinations induce tumor regression. Thus, neurofibromin is a dual repressor
  for both Ras and ER signaling, and co-targeting may treat neurofibromin-deficient
  ER+ breast tumors.
