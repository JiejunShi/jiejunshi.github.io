abstract: SLC7A11-mediated cystine uptake is critical for maintaining redox balance
  and cell survival. Here we show that this comes at a significant cost for cancer
  cells with high levels of SLC7A11. Actively importing cystine is potentially toxic
  due to its low solubility, forcing cancer cells with high levels of SLC7A11 (SLC7A11high)
  to constitutively reduce cystine to the more soluble cysteine. This presents a significant
  drain on the cellular NADPH pool and renders such cells dependent on the pentose
  phosphate pathway. Limiting glucose supply to SLC7A11high cancer cells results in
  marked accumulation of intracellular cystine, redox system collapse and rapid cell
  death, which can be rescued by treatments that prevent disulfide accumulation. We
  further show that inhibitors of glucose transporters selectively kill SLC7A11high
  cancer cells and suppress SLC7A11high tumour growth. Our results identify a coupling
  between SLC7A11-associated cystine metabolism and the pentose phosphate pathway,
  and uncover an accompanying metabolic vulnerability for therapeutic targeting in
  SLC7A11high cancers.
