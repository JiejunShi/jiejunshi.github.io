abstract: Circos plots are widely used to display multi-dimensional next-generation
  genomic data, but existing implementations of Circos are not interactive with limited
  support of data types. Here, we developed next-generation Circos (NG-Circos), a
  flexible JavaScript-based circular genome visualization tool for designing highly
  interactive Circos plots using 21 functional modules with various data types. To
  our knowledge, NG-Circos is the most powerful software to construct interactive
  Circos plots. By supporting diverse data types in a dynamic browser interface, NG-Circos
  will accelerate the next-generation data visualization and interpretation, thus
  promoting the reproducible research in biomedical sciences and beyond. NG-Circos
  is available at https://wlcb.oit.uci.edu/NG-Circos and https://github.com/YaCui/NG-Circos.
