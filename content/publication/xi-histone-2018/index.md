abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Epigenetic regulators are frequently mutated or aberrantly
  expressed in a variety of cancers, leading to altered transcription states that
  result in changes in cell identity, behavior, and response to therapy. RESULTS:
  To define alterations in epigenetic landscapes in breast cancers, we profiled the
  distributions of 8 key histone modifications by ChIP-Seq, as well as primary (GRO-seq)
  and steady state (RNA-Seq) transcriptomes, across 13 distinct cell lines that represent
  5 molecular subtypes of breast cancer and immortalized human mammary epithelial
  cells. DISCUSSION: Using combinatorial patterns of distinct histone modification
  signals, we defined subtype-specific chromatin signatures to nominate potential
  biomarkers. This approach identified AFAP1-AS1 as a triple negative breast cancer-specific
  gene associated with cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal-transition. In
  addition, our chromatin mapping data in basal TNBC cell lines are consistent with
  gene expression patterns in TCGA that indicate decreased activity of the androgen
  receptor pathway but increased activity of the vitamin D biosynthesis pathway. CONCLUSIONS:
  Together, these datasets provide a comprehensive resource for histone modification
  profiles that define epigenetic landscapes and reveal key chromatin signatures in
  breast cancer cell line subtypes with potential to identify novel and actionable
  targets for treatment.'
