abstract: Human p300 is a transcriptional co-activator and a major acetyltransferase
  that acetylates histones and other proteins facilitating gene transcription. The
  activity of p300 relies on the fine-tuned interactome that involves a dozen p300
  domains and hundreds of binding partners and links p300 to a wide range of vital
  signaling events. Here, we report a novel function of the ZZ-type zinc finger (ZZ)
  of p300 as a reader of histone H3. We show that the ZZ domain and acetyllysine-recognizing
  bromodomain of p300 play critical roles in modulating p300 enzymatic activity and
  its association with chromatin. The acetyllysine binding function of bromodomain
  is essential for acetylation of histones H3 and H4, whereas interaction of the ZZ
  domain with H3 promotes selective acetylation of the histone H3K27 and H3K18 sites.
