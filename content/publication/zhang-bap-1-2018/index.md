abstract: The roles and regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis (a non-apoptotic form
  of cell death) in cancer remain unclear. The tumour suppressor BRCA1-associated
  protein 1 (BAP1) encodes a nuclear deubiquitinating enzyme to reduce histone 2A
  ubiquitination (H2Aub) on chromatin. Here, integrated transcriptomic, epigenomic
  and cancer genomic analyses link BAP1 to metabolism-related biological processes,
  and identify cystine transporter SLC7A11 as a key BAP1 target gene in human cancers.
  Functional studies reveal that BAP1 decreases H2Aub occupancy on the SLC7A11 promoter
  and represses SLC7A11 expression in a deubiquitinating-dependent manner, and that
  BAP1 inhibits cystine uptake by repressing SLC7A11 expression, leading to elevated
  lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Furthermore, we show that BAP1 inhibits tumour
  development partly through SLC7A11 and ferroptosis, and that cancer-associated BAP1
  mutants lose their abilities to repress SLC7A11 and to promote ferroptosis. Together,
  our results uncover a previously unappreciated epigenetic mechanism coupling ferroptosis
  to tumour suppression.
