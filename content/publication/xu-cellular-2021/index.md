abstract: Promoter DNA methylation is a well-established mechanism of transcription
  repression, though its global correlation with gene expression is weak. This weak
  correlation can be attributed to the failure of current methylation quantification
  methods to consider the heterogeneity among sequenced bulk cells. Here, we introduce
  Cell Heterogeneity-Adjusted cLonal Methylation (CHALM) as a methylation quantification
  method. CHALM improves understanding of the functional consequences of DNA methylation,
  including its correlations with gene expression and H3K4me3. When applied to different
  methylation datasets, the CHALM method enables detection of differentially methylated
  genes that exhibit distinct biological functions supporting underlying mechanisms.
