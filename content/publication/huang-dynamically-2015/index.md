abstract: Nucleosome positioning and histone modification play a critical role in
  gene regulation, but their role during reprogramming has not been fully elucidated.
  Here, we determined the genome-wide nucleosome coverage and histone methylation
  occupancy in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), induced pluripotent stem cells
  (iPSCs) and pre-iPSCs. We found that nucleosome occupancy increases in promoter
  regions and decreases in intergenic regions in pre-iPSCs, then recovers to an intermediate
  level in iPSCs. We also found that nucleosomes in pre-iPSCs are much more phased
  than those in MEFs and iPSCs. During reprogramming, nucleosome reorganization and
  histone methylation around transcription start sites (TSSs) are highly coordinated
  with distinctively transcriptional activities. Bivalent promoters gradually increase,
  while repressive promoters gradually decrease. High CpG (HCG) promoters of active
  genes are characterized by nucleosome depletion at TSSs, while low CpG (LCG) promoters
  exhibit the opposite characteristics. In addition, we show that vitamin C (VC) promotes
  reorganizations of canonical, H3K4me3- and H3K27me3-modified nucleosomes on specific
  genes during transition from pre-iPSCs to iPSCs. These data demonstrate that pre-iPSCs
  have a more open and phased chromatin architecture than that of MEFs and iPSCs.
  Finally, this study reveals the dynamics and critical roles of nucleosome positioning
  and chromatin organization in gene regulation during reprogramming.
