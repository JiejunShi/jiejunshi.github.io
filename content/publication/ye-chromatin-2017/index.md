abstract: 'Neurons are a key component of the nervous system and differentiate from
  multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs). Chromatin remodeling has a critical role in
  the differentiation process. However, its in vivo epigenetic regulatory role remains
  unknown. We show here that nucleosome depletion regions (NDRs) form in both proximal
  promoters and distal enhancers during NSCs differentiating into neurons in the early
  Drosophila embryonic development. NDR formation in the regulatory regions involves
  nucleosome shift and eviction. Nucleosome occupancy in promoter NDRs is inversely
  proportional to the gene activity. Genes with promoter NDR formation during differentiation
  are enriched for functions related to neuron development and maturation. Active
  histone-modification signals (H3K4me3 and H3K9ac) in promoters are gained in neurons
  in two modes: de novo establishment to high levels or increase from the existing
  levels in NSCs. The gene sets corresponding to the two modes have different neuron-related
  functions. Dynamic changes of H3K27ac and H3K9ac signals in enhancers and promoters
  synergistically repress genes associated with neural stem or progenitor cell-related
  pluripotency and upregulate genes associated with neuron projection morphogenesis,
  neuron differentiation, and so on. Our results offer new insights into chromatin
  remodeling during in vivo neuron development and lay a foundation for its epigenetic
  regulatory mechanism study of other lineage specification.'
