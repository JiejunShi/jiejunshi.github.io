abstract: Tumor cells become resistant after long-term use of anti-VEGF (vascular
  endothelial growth factor) agents. Our previous study shows that treatment with
  a VEGF inhibitor (VEGF-Trap) facilitates to develop tumor resistance through regulating
  angiogenesis-related genes. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain
  elusive. Histone modifications as a key epigenetic factor play a critical role in
  regulation of gene expression. Here, we explore the potential epigenetic gene regulatory
  functions of key histone modifications during tumor resistance in a mouse Lewis
  lung carcinoma (LLC) cell line. We generated high resolution genome-wide maps of
  key histone modifications in sensitive tumor sample (LLC-NR) and resistant tumor
  sample (LLC-R) after VEGF-Trap treatment. Profiling analysis of histone modifications
  shows that histone modification levels are effectively predictive for gene expression.
  Composition of promoters classified by histone modification state is different between
  LLC-NR and LLC-R cell lines regardless of CpG content. Histone modification state
  change between LLC-NR and LLC-R cell lines shows different patterns in CpG-rich
  and CpG-poor promoters. As a consequence, genes with different level of CpG content
  whose gene expression level are altered are enriched in distinct functions. Notably,
  histone modification state change in promoters of angiogenesis-related genes consists
  with their expression alteration. Taken together, our findings suggest that treatment
  with anti-VEGF therapy results in extensive histone modification state change in
  promoters with multiple functions, particularly, biological processes related to
  angiogenesis, likely contributing to tumor resistance development.
