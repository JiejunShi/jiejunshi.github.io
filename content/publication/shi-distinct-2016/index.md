abstract: 'Aflatoxin is a natural potent carcinogen and a major cause of liver cancer.
  However, the molecular mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinogenesis remain largely
  unexplored. In this study, we profiled global gene expression in liver tissues of
  rats that developed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) administration
  and those that were AFB1-resistant, as well as rats without AFB1 exposure as a control.
  AFB1 exposure resulted in extensive perturbation in gene expression with different
  functions in HCC and AFB1 resistance (AR) samples. The differentially expressed
  genes (DEGs) in HCC sample were enriched for cell proliferation, cell adhesion and
  vasculature development that largely contribute to carcinogenesis. Anti-apoptosis
  genes were up-regulated in HCC sample whereas apoptosis-induction genes were up-regulated
  in AR sample. AFB1 exposure also caused extensive alteration in expression level
  of lncRNAs. Among all the 4511 annotated lncRNAs, half of them were highly expressed
  only in HCC sample and up-regulated a group of protein-coding genes with cancer-related
  functions: apoptosis regulation, DNA repair, and cell cycle. Intriguingly, these
  genes were down-regulated by lncRNAs highly expressed in AR sample. Collectively,
  apoptosis is the critical biological process for carcinogenesis in response to AFB1
  exposure through changes in expression level of both protein-coding and lncRNA genes.'
