abstract: Circadian gene expression driven by transcription activators CLOCK and BMAL1
  is intimately associated with dynamic chromatin remodeling. However, how cellular
  metabolism directs circadian chromatin remodeling is virtually unexplored. We report
  that the S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolyzing enzyme adenosylhomocysteinase
  (AHCY) cyclically associates to CLOCK-BMAL1 at chromatin sites and promotes circadian
  transcriptional activity. SAH is a potent feedback inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine
  (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases, and timely hydrolysis of SAH by AHCY is critical
  to sustain methylation reactions. We show that AHCY is essential for cyclic H3K4
  trimethylation, genome-wide recruitment of BMAL1 to chromatin, and subsequent circadian
  transcription. Depletion or targeted pharmacological inhibition of AHCY in mammalian
  cells markedly decreases the amplitude of circadian gene expression. In mice, pharmacological
  inhibition of AHCY in the hypothalamus alters circadian locomotor activity and rhythmic
  transcription within the suprachiasmatic nucleus. These results reveal a previously
  unappreciated connection between cellular metabolism, chromatin dynamics, and circadian
  regulation.
