abstract: Hematopoietic development is tightly regulated by various factors. The role of RNA m6A 
modification during fetal hematopoiesis, particularly in megakaryopoiesis, remains unclear. Here, 
we demonstrate that loss of m6A methyltransferase METTL3 induces formation of double-stranded RNAs 
(dsRNAs) and activates acute inflammation during fetal hematopoiesis. This dsRNA-mediated inflammation
leads to acute megakaryopoiesis, which facilitates the generation of megakaryocyte progenitors (MkP)
but disrupts megakaryocyte maturation and platelet production. The inflammation and immune response
activate the phosphorylation of STAT1 and IRF3, and upregulate downstream interferon-stimulated
genes (ISGs). Inflammation inhibits the proliferation rate of hematopoietic progenitors and 
further skews the cell fate determination toward megakaryocytes rather than erythroid from 
megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs). Transcriptional-wide gene expression analysis 
identifies IGF1 as a major factor whose reduction is responsible for the inhibition of 
megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis. Restoration of IGF1 with METTL3-deficient hematopoietic 
cells significantly increase megakaryocyte maturation. In summary, we elucidate that the loss 
of RNA m6A modification-induced acute inflammation activates acute megakaryopoiesis but impairs 
its final maturation through the inhibition of IGF1 expression during fetal hematopoiesis.
