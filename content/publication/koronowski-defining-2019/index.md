abstract: Mammals rely on a network of circadian clocks to control daily systemic
  metabolism and physiology. The central pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus
  (SCN) is considered hierarchically dominant over peripheral clocks, whose degree
  of independence, or tissue-level autonomy, has never been ascertained in vivo. Using
  arrhythmic Bmal1-null mice, we generated animals with reconstituted circadian expression
  of BMAL1 exclusively in the liver (Liver-RE). High-throughput transcriptomics and
  metabolomics show that the liver has independent circadian functions specific for
  metabolic processes such as the NAD+ salvage pathway and glycogen turnover. However,
  although BMAL1 occupies chromatin at most genomic targets in Liver-RE mice, circadian
  expression is restricted to ∼10% of normally rhythmic transcripts. Finally, rhythmic
  clock gene expression is lost in Liver-RE mice under constant darkness. Hence, full
  circadian function in the liver depends on signals emanating from other clocks,
  and light contributes to tissue-autonomous clock function.
