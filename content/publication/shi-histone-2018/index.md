abstract: Histone H3 encoding genes, particularly H3F3A and H3F3B, the genes encoding
  the variant histone H3.3, are mutated at high frequency in pediatric brain and bone
  malignancies. Compared to the extensive studies on K27M and K36M mutations, little
  is known about the mechanism of G34 mutations found in pediatric glioblastoma or
  giant cell tumors of the bone. Here we report that unlike the K27M or K36M that
  affect global histone methylation, the giant cell tumors of the bone G34 mutations
  (G34L/W) only affect histone H3K36 and H3K27 methylation on the same mutated histone
  tails (in cis), a mechanism distinct from known histone mutations.
