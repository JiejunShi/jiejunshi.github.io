abstract: The mammalian circadian clock, expressed throughout the brain and body,
  controls daily metabolic homeostasis. Clock function in peripheral tissues is required,
  but not sufficient, for this task. Because of the lack of specialized animal models,
  it is unclear how tissue clocks interact with extrinsic signals to drive molecular
  oscillations. Here, we isolated the interaction between feeding and the liver clock
  by reconstituting Bmal1 exclusively in hepatocytes (Liver-RE), in otherwise clock-less
  mice, and controlling timing of food intake. We found that the cooperative action
  of BMAL1 and the transcription factor CEBPB regulates daily liver metabolic transcriptional
  programs. Functionally, the liver clock and feeding rhythm are sufficient to drive
  temporal carbohydrate homeostasis. By contrast, liver rhythms tied to redox and
  lipid metabolism required communication with the skeletal muscle clock, demonstrating
  peripheral clock cross-talk. Our results highlight how the inner workings of the
  clock system rely on communicating signals to maintain daily metabolism.
