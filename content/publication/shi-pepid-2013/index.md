abstract: 'Epigenetic mechanisms play key roles in initiation and progression of prostate
  cancer by changing gene expression. The Prostate Epigenetic Database (PEpiD: http://wukong.tongji.edu.cn/pepid)
  archives the three extensively characterized epigenetic mechanisms DNA methylation,
  histone modification, and microRNA implicated in prostate cancer of human, mouse,
  and rat. PEpiD uses a distinct color scheme to present the three types of epigenetic
  data and provides a user-friendly interface for flexible query. The retrieved information
  includes Refseq ID, gene symbol, gene alias, genomic loci of epigenetic changes,
  tissue source, experimental method, and supportive references. The change of histone
  modification (hyper or hypo) and the corresponding gene expression change (up or
  down) are also indicated. A graphic view of DNA methylation with exon-intron structure
  and predicted CpG islands is provided as well. Moreover, the prostate-related ENCODE
  tracks (DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodelers), and other
  key transcription factors with reported roles in prostate are displayed in the browser
  as well. The reversibility of epigenetic aberrations has made them potential markers
  for diagnosis and prognosis, and targets for treatment of cancers. This curated
  information will improve our understanding of epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation
  in prostate cancer, and serve as an important resource for epigenetic research in
  prostate cancer.'
