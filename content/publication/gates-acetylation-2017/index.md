abstract: The transition from transcription initiation to elongation is a key regulatory
  step in gene expression, which requires RNA polymerase II (pol II) to escape promoter
  proximal pausing on chromatin. Although elongation factors promote pause release
  leading to transcription elongation, the role of epigenetic modifications during
  this critical transition step is poorly understood. Two histone marks on histone
  H3, lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac), co-localize
  on active gene promoters and are associated with active transcription. H3K4me3 can
  promote transcription initiation, yet the functional role of H3K9ac is much less
  understood. We hypothesized that H3K9ac may function downstream of transcription
  initiation by recruiting proteins important for the next step of transcription.
  Here, we describe a functional role for H3K9ac in promoting pol II pause release
  by directly recruiting the super elongation complex (SEC) to chromatin. H3K9ac serves
  as a substrate for direct binding of the SEC, as does acetylation of histone H4
  lysine 5 to a lesser extent. Furthermore, lysine 9 on histone H3 is necessary for
  maximal pol II pause release through SEC action, and loss of H3K9ac increases the
  pol II pausing index on a subset of genes in HeLa cells. At select gene promoters,
  H3K9ac loss or SEC depletion reduces gene expression and increases paused pol II
  occupancy. We therefore propose that an ordered histone code can promote progression
  through the transcription cycle, providing new mechanistic insight indicating that
  SEC recruitment to certain acetylated histones on a subset of genes stimulates the
  subsequent release of paused pol II needed for transcription elongation.
