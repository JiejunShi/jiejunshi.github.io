abstract: Histone acetylation is associated with active transcription in eukaryotic
  cells. It helps to open up the chromatin by neutralizing the positive charge of
  histone lysine residues and providing binding platforms for \"reader\" proteins.
  The bromodomain (BRD) has long been thought to be the sole protein module that recognizes
  acetylated histones. Recently, we identified the YEATS domain of AF9 (ALL1 fused
  gene from chromosome 9) as a novel acetyl-lysine-binding module and showed that
  the ENL (eleven-nineteen leukemia) YEATS domain is an essential acetyl-histone reader
  in acute myeloid leukemias. The human genome encodes four YEATS domain proteins,
  including GAS41, a component of chromatin remodelers responsible for H2A.Z deposition
  onto chromatin; however, the importance of the GAS41 YEATS domain in human cancer
  remains largely unknown. Here we report that GAS41 is frequently amplified in human
  non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is required for cancer cell proliferation,
  survival, and transformation. Biochemical and crystal structural studies demonstrate
  that GAS41 binds to histone H3 acetylated on H3K27 and H3K14, a specificity that
  is distinct from that of AF9 or ENL. ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation [ChIP]
  followed by high-throughput sequencing) analyses in lung cancer cells reveal that
  GAS41 colocalizes with H3K27ac and H3K14ac on the promoters of actively transcribed
  genes. Depletion of GAS41 or disruption of the interaction between its YEATS domain
  and acetylated histones impairs the association of histone variant H2A.Z with chromatin
  and consequently suppresses cancer cell growth and survival both in vitro and in
  vivo. Overall, our study identifies GAS41 as a histone acetylation reader that promotes
  histone H2A.Z deposition in NSCLC.
